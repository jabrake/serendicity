        <h2>What is Serendicity?</h2>
        
        <div class="body_text">Serendicity is an attempt to upend the normative travel experience. Travelers often have a specific destination in mind when they arrive to a new city. Rather than taking the fastest route there, why not explore a more interesting one?
        
        <br><br>
        
        Leveraging open APIs and frameworks, the mobile app generates walking routes based on location, time, and preferences. The end result: less structure, more serendipity, and hopefully a different travel experience.</div>

        <h2>Why should you use Serendicity?</h2>

        <div class="body_text">The Internet provides us with a wealth of information and ways to self-curate everything we do, from the media we consume and the food we eat, to our circle of friends. The same phenomenon applies to travel: we arm ourselves with information and research about our destinations before we even get there. This often leads to trips structured with checklists, schedules, itineraries, and high expectations.

        <br><br>

        Serendicity aims to bring serendipity back into travel. Leaving things up to chance can be a good thing.</div>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <div class="body_text">Three simple steps: find your destination, pick a category of stops, and indicate how much time you have. Serendicity uses Foursquare's API for location information, and the Google Maps API to create personalized walking routes.</div>

        <h2>Future</h2>

        <div class="body_text">Serendicity is a labor of love. Many new features are yet to be implemented, allowing for a more robust experience. If you'd like to contribute or just chat, drop me a line: jorge.brake@gmail.com.</div>
